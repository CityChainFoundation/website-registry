# City Chain Registry

The City Chain Registry is a registry of entities.

Think of the City Chain Registry as a form for smart yellow pages, where entities can register and announce changes and updates related to their entities.

This service is made available to be an alternative to centralized and national registries. It is borderless and permissionless.

Registrations in this registry does not result in any legal registration in the entity country of residence. It is your responsibility to follow local and regional laws and regulations.

The City Chain Registry CC is a crypto company registered in this registry. The crypto company has no physical locality or regionality, and is not registered in any national registry.

## Description

Work-in-progress:

One of the most important decisions to be made on implementation details for the registry of entities, is whether each entity should require to be its own DID Subject, or simply an Verifiable Credential (VC).

The DID Document for the entity could be from any supported DID Method, and it could be the authority for which keys are allowed to perform updated to the entity in the registration.

The other alternative is to simply make the entity an Verifiable Credential, where it lists different DID Subjects ("people") with different roles in the organization, like "CEO" and "CFO".
